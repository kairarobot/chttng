[This is](http://kaira.one/chttng) made with twine engine and the magic of JavaScript/HTML/CSS.

Everything is happening under `index.html`. The content of the applications is contained under `tw-passagedata`and an in-text CSS is provided above the body. The JavaScript appended is essetinally the twine engine. Also, this is an absolutely senseless project that expresses the ambivalance I sometimes feel when someone asks me to play a game with them.
